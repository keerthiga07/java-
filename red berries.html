  Red berries are plentiful in nature, but not all of them can be safely eaten.<br>
 The red berries that can be consumed, however, are among many peopleâ€™s favorite foods.<br>
 They show up in pies, cobblers, jams or are simply eaten raw.<br> 
Berries are plentiful in many states and can be rewarding for the home gardener.
There are over 200 species of raspberries,<br>
 which explains why they can be grown anywhere from icy Southern Chile to steamy Ecuador. The raspberries you buy in the store are often red, but they can also be black, purple, orange or yellow. Raspberries, like most berries, are low in calories and high in nutrients, providing more than half the RDA for vitamin C.
