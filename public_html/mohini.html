<title>MOHINI DANCE</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3> Mohiniyattam</h3> , is an Indian classical dance form that developed and remained popular in the state of Kerala.<br>
Kathakali is another classical dance form of Kerala.<br> Mohiniyattam dance gets its name from the word Mohini – a historical enchantress avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu,<br>
who helps the good prevail over evil by developing her feminine powers.<br>

Mohiniyattam's roots, like all classical Indian dances, are in the Natya Shastra – the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text on performance arts.<br>
However, it follows the Lasya style described in Natya Shastra, that is a dance which is delicate, eros-filled and feminine.<br>
It is traditionally a solo dance performed by women after extensive training, though nowadays men can also perform the dance.<br> 
The repertoire of Mohiniyattam includes music in the Carnatic style,<br>
singing and acting a play through the dance, where the recitation may be either by a separate vocalist or the dancer themselves.<br><!-- comment -->
The song is typically in Malayalam-Sanskrit hybrid called Manipravalam.<br>

The earliest mention of the word is found in the 16th-century legal text Vyavaharamala,<br>
but the likely roots of the dance are older.<br>
The dance was systematized in the 18th century, was ridiculed as a Devadasi prostitution system during the colonial British Raj,<br>
banned by a series of laws from 1931 through 1938, a ban that was protested and partially repealed in 1940.<br>
The socio-political conflict ultimately led to renewed interest,<br> revival and reconstruction of Mohiniyattam by the people of Kerala, particularly the poet Vallathol Narayana Menon.
