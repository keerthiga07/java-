        <h2>The proverb, </h2>
        "An apple a day keeps the doctor away",<br>addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit, has been traced to 19th-century Wales,<br> where the original phrase was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread".[43]<br> In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to "an apple a day, no doctor to pay" and "an apple a day sends the doctor away";<br> the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.[44]<br>
