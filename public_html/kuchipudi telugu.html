<h3>Kuchipudi)</h3>  is one of the eight major Indian classical dances.<br>[2]
  It originates from a village named Kuchipudi in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.<>br[3]

Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra.<br>
It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India.<br>
[ Evidence of Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are found in copper inscriptions of the 10th century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the Machupalli Kaifat.<br>
 Kuchipudi tradition holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati – a sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta persuasion,and his disciple, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi,<br> founded and systematized the modern version of Kuchipudi in the 17th century.[11][12][13] Kuchipudi largely developed as a Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition,<br>
 and it is known by the name of Bhagavata Mela in Thanjavur.<br>

The traditional Kuchipudi was performed by all males troupe.<br> A dancer in a male role would be in Agnivastra, also known as Bagalbandi, wear a dhoti <br>
(a single pleated piece of cloth hanging down from the waist). A dancer in a female role would wear a Sari with light makeup.<br>

The Kuchipudi performance usually begins with an invocation.<br> Then, each costumed actor is introduced, their role stated, and they then perform a short preliminary dance set to music (dharavu).<br> 
Next, the performance presents pure dance (nritta).<br>
This is followed with by the expressive part of the performance (nritya), <br>where rhythmic hand gestures help convey the story.<br>
Vocal and instrumental Carnatic music in the Telugu language accompanies the performance.<br>
The typical musical instruments in Kuchipudi are mridangam, cymbals, veena, flute and the tambura.
