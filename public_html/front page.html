       <h1> INDIAN DANCE</h1>
       <p style="color:black;">
           Dance in India comprises numerous styles of dances, generally classified as classical or folk.<br><!-- comment -->
           As with other aspects of Indian culture, different forms of dances originated in different parts of India,<br> 
           developed according to the local traditions and also imbibed elements from other parts of the country.<br>

Sangeet Natya Academy, the national academy for performing arts in India, recognizes eight traditional dances as Indian classical dances,<br>
while other sources and scholars recognize more.<br>
These have roots in the Sanskrit text Natya Shastra,<br> 
and the religious performance arts of Hinduism.<br>
