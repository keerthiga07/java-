<h2>About Pattadakal</h2>
Pattadakallu, commonly known as Pattadakal is a small village in Karnataka and the embodiment of an Indian architectural marvel.<br> Located on the banks of the Malaprabha River,<br> this village is a UNESCO declared a world heritage site.<br> ‘Pattadakallu’ translates to “place of coronation”. As the name suggests, all kings of the Chalukya dynasty were crowned here, making it a place of great historic and cultural significance.<br>

This village is home to about ten temples including a few Jain shrines and other monuments and inscriptions. The temples in Pattadakal are regarded as architectural extraordinaire and uphold the rich history of the place.
